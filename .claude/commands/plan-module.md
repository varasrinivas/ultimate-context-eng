Create a detailed module plan for: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for project standards, design system, and content rules
2. Read `docs/curriculum-map.md` to find the module's track, title, topics, analogy, and cross-links
3. If this is NOT M00, read `plans/M00-plan.md` as a reference for plan structure and depth
4. If there's a previous module in the same track, read its plan for continuity

Create the plan at `plans/$ARGUMENTS-plan.md` with these sections:

## Module Identity
- ID, Track, Title, Subtitle, Icon, Color (from TRACK_META)

## Everyday Analogy
- The analogy title and full text (3-4 sentences, from a familiar domain)
- How the analogy maps to each key concept

## Key Topics (4-6)
- Each topic with a 2-sentence expansion
- Which topic gets the MedFlow domain example (and which app mode toggle demonstrates it)

## Sections Outline
- Section-by-section plan with type (content/analogy/code/quiz/antipattern)
- For code sections: specify language, what the code demonstrates, MedFlow domain tie-in (mode toggle + expected TokenReceipt shape)
- For quiz sections: draft the question, 4 options, correct answer, explanation
- For antipattern sections: list 2-3 anti-patterns with consequences

## SVG Diagram Plan
- What the diagram shows (conceptual sketch in ASCII)
- Key visual elements, labels, colors
- How it reinforces the analogy

## Cross-Links
- Which Agent/SDLC modules to reference and why

## Lab Briefs
- Understand It: what the learner observes/analyzes, expected output
- Build It with AI: what the learner constructs, key steps, expected deliverable

## Context Engineering Takeaway
- The one-sentence summary

## Anti-Patterns
- 2-3 things that go wrong when you skip or misapply this module's concepts

## Continuity Notes
- What prior modules this builds on
- What future modules will reference this
